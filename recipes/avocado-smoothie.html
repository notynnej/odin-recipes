    <h2>Description</h2>
    An iconic Vietnamese beverage, the avocado smoothie is a thick mixture of just 3 ingredients: avocados, condensed milk, and milk. Rather than drinking the smoothie, it requires a spoon, much like scooping up yogurt. Delicious and refreshing, try making a batch!
    <h2>Ingredients (2 servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe avocados</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tbsp condensed milk <em>(for sweetness)</em></li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk <em>(for consistency)</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup ice <em>(for coldness)</em></li>
    </ul>
    You can adjust the condensed milk, milk, and ice to your liking.
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Halve the avocados, remove the pits, and scoop the contents into a blender.</li>
        <li>Add milk, condensed milk, and ice to the blender.</li>
        <li>Blend, serve, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
